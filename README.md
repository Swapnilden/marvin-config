# MARVIN-config

Configuration files for MARVIN on the TIB servers, public for forking the architecture

# Acknowledgements
We thank SÃ¶ren Auer and the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) for providing three servers to run:

* the main DBpedia extraction on a monthly basis 
* community-provided extractors on Wikipedia, Wikidata or other sources 
* enrichment, cleaning and parsing services, so-called [Databus mods](https://github.com/dbpedia/databus-mods/) for open data on the Databus

This contribution by TIB is a great push towards incentivizing Open Data and establishing a global and national research and innovation data infrastructure.
